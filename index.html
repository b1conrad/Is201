    <p>
        Leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced that the Castle Valley Pageant was sold.<br>
        Although no buyer name or amount has been announced, <br> comments have been made that the purchaser plans to turn the lower parking lot into a campground.<br>
        The pageant began in 1978 as the dream of its author Montell Seely.<br>
        The site was state owned and required a special use permit, which was obtained from the office of state lands.<br>
        In 1990, it became authorized as an official church pageant, <br> funded and produced by the missionary department from church headquarters.
